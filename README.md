# Ansible Starter

This is my starter repo where I have all the setup I need to get up and running quickly.

## Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com) - Git is a free and open source distributed version
  control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects
  with speed and efficiency.
- [Ansible](https://ansible.com) - simple, agentless and powerful open source
  IT automation

## How to run

```bash
bash ./run.sh
```

This will take care of intalling any ansible dependencies, setting up ssh keys,
installing system packages and configuring everything.

### Windows

Use WSL, windows configuration is missing for now and might in fact never be here.
