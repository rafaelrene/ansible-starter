# Global Agent Rules

## General Rules

- In all interactions and messages, be extremely concise even if it means sacrificing grammar
- Don't add comments unless they are necessary. If code is self-documenting, you're forbidden to add comments.
- At the end of each interaction, if you've changed any code ensure that it's properly linted and formatted.

## Git

- Don't use git without user approval. Don't commit or push unless you're explicitly asked to do so.

## Plans

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
- Each plan should be concise and to the point.
- Each plan should be presented as a list of actions to take followed by a list of unresolved questions.
